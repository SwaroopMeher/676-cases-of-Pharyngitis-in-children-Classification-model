# 676-cases-of-Pharyngitis-in-children-Classification-model

Our goal is to predict the result of the rapid antigen detection test for Group A streptococcus (GAS) infection using signs and symptoms in children with pharyngitis. The model built will help the physicians decide whether they can rely on signs and symptoms to select pediatric patients with pharyngitis who should undergo rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) for GAS.

A series of experiments were performed to find the best model that predicts if a child with pharyngitis should be recommended to a rapid antigen test by a physician.
